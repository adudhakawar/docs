## New features

### Multi-domain SAML setup

[SAML single sign-on]({{< relref "/operate/rc/security/access-control/saml-sso" >}}) now supports multiple username domains. Select **Manage domains** on the **Single sign-on** screen to associate additional domains to your SAML setup.

### SAML domain verification

We added domain verification to [SAML single sign-on]({{< relref "/operate/rc/security/access-control/saml-sso" >}}) to enhance security. Before you set up SAML in Redis Cloud, you must first [verify domain ownership]({{< relref "/operate/rc/security/access-control/saml-sso#verify-domain" >}}) for any domains associated with your SAML setup.

If you have an active SAML configuration, you can still sign in with SAML SSO, but your domains will be set to **Unverified**. You should [verify domain ownership]({{< relref "/operate/rc/security/access-control/saml-sso#verify-domain" >}}) as soon as possible.

### Active-Active Search and query support

[Active-Active databases]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/configuration/active-active-redis" >}}) on Redis Cloud now support [Search and query]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/search" >}}). 

See [Create an Active-Active database]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/create-database/create-active-active-database" >}}) to learn how to create an Active-Active database.

See [Search and query Active-Active databases]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/search/search-active-active" >}}) to learn how to use Search and query on Active-Active databases.
